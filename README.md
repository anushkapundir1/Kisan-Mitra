## Overview
Kisan AI Mitra is a Python-based farmer assistance system aimed at
providing basic agricultural guidance through structured logic and
AI-assisted responses.

The project focuses on helping users (farmers) get simple,
understandable recommendations related to crops, farming practices,
and common agricultural queries.


## Key Features
- Upload and analyze crop and soil images
- AI-based disease detection
- Fertilizer and crop-care recommendations like temperature, climate, soil conditions
